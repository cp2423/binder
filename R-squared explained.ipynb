    "\n",
    "Here is one definition of R-squared from [Statistics By Jim](https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/interpret-r-squared-regression/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> R-squared is a goodness-of-fit measure for linear regression models. This statistic indicates the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that the independent variables explain collectively. R-squared measures the strength of the relationship between your model and the dependent variable on a convenient 0 – 100% scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition from [scikit learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.score):\n",
    ">The coefficient $ R^2 $ is defined as $ (1 - \\frac{u}{v}) $, where $ u $ is the residual sum of squares ``((y_true - y_pred)** 2).sum()`` and $ v $ is the total sum of squares ``((y_true - y_true.mean()) ** 2).sum()``. The best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always predicts the expected value of `y`, disregarding the input features, would get a $ R^2 $ score of 0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall the same thing written in a slightly different way:\n",

    "1. Introduce some data and make a linear regression model\n",
    "1. Understand residual sum of squares (RSS)\n",
    "1. Understand total sum of squares (TSS)\n",
    "1. Finally just do: `1 - (RSS/TSS)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards we will also look into the contradiction in the definitions above around whether $ R^2 $ can be negative or not, plus how to interpret the value i.e. \"what is a *good* $ R^2 $ score?\""

    "### What is a \"good\" score?\n",
    "\n",
    "This almost entirely **depends on the context** in which you are working. Let's say your model has $ R^2 = 0.3 $ so less than a third of the variation in your *y* variable is explained by your model. You might think that this is not very good. In most real-world scenarios, however, the are a **huge** number of factors that could have an impact on the thing that you are trying to model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take bike rentals. How many crazy factors could you dream up that could feasibly affect the number of people that decide to hire a bicycle on any given day? Here are some ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* what condition are the local cycle routes in?\n",
    "* is there an event on which might drive hires up? (Or down?)\n",
    "* is there a social media craze going on for kids filming themselves on hire bikes?\n",
    "* how is the economy doing, do people have spare money for bike rides?\n",
    "\n",
    "There could be **literally millions** of potential factors, so having 30% of the variation explained by your model is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead you are doing some sort of highly controlled, scientific study and there is literally only one or two other factors that could potentially affect your *y* values, then having only 30% explained by your model is rubbish - try modelling those other factors instead!\n",
    "\n",
    "It also depends on exactly **what are you trying to achieve** with your model. Knowing that a full 30% of the variation in bike hires is explained by only one or two factors could be a hugely valuable insight for this business. If instead they are trying to create a really robust model which accurately predict bike hires in the future then 0.3 is unlikely to cut it - but even then the business should remember that [predicting the future is hard](http://www.rinkworks.com/said/predictions.shtml) bordering on impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it is worth noting that a partiucularly high score for a predictive model is not a good idea as this would suggest that the model has been overfitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth reading the whole [Statistics By Jim piece on R-squared](https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/interpret-r-squared-regression/) for how to interpret scores but bear in mind that it does include an error when it says that R-squared is always between 0 and 100%, because R-squared can be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can a square number ever be negative?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic maths says that any number which has been squared (multiplied by itself) cannot have a negative value because a negative number multiplied by another negative number (in this case, itself) gives a positive number!\n",
